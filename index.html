                    <p><em>by Paulo Coelho</em></p>
                    <p>
                        The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is an allegorical novel about Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who embarks on a journey to the Egyptian pyramids in search of a hidden treasure revealed in his recurring dreams, learning profound life lessons about following one's dreams, listening to one's heart, and recognizing omens along the way. His journey is guided by various mentors and encounters, including a king named Melchizedek, a crystal merchant, and an alchemist, as he faces challenges and discovers that the true treasure is not just the physical gold but the wisdom gained and the fulfillment found in pursuing one's "Personal Legend".
